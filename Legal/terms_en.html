  <h1 class="h1">Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>AI Scores Predict</strong> (“App”). These Terms form a binding agreement between you and <strong>LBTeam</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). By creating an account or using the App you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">1) What we do</h2>
  <p>The App analyzes publicly available and licensed football/soccer data (e.g., historical results, team form, player and match statistics) to generate <em>predictions and tips</em>. The outputs are algorithmic estimates and may be wrong. The App does <strong>not</strong> offer or facilitate gambling.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">2) Eligibility & responsible use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 16 years old (or the minimum age in your country if higher). If local laws treat betting-related content as age-restricted, you must meet that age.</li>
    <li>Use the App for <strong>entertainment and informational purposes only</strong>. Do not rely on tips for financial decisions.</li>
    <li>Comply with your local laws. We make no representation that the App is appropriate in your jurisdiction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h2">3) Accounts & security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for your account, the accuracy of your information, and keeping your password secure.</li>
    <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts for breaches (e.g., abuse, scraping, reverse engineering).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h2">4) License & acceptable use</h2>
  <p>We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App. You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy, modify, reverse engineer, or resell the App or outputs;</li>
    <li>Scrape or bulk-download data or predictions;</li>
    <li>Use the App to build or train a competing service;</li>
    <li>Interfere with or overload our systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h2">5) Content & intellectual property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All rights in the App, models, and content are owned by us or our licensors.</li>
    <li>We are not affiliated with any league, club, or governing body. Logos and trademarks belong to their respective owners.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h2">6) Predictions & disclaimers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Predictions are probabilistic and may be inaccurate or outdated.</li>
    <li><strong>No warranty:</strong> the App is provided “as is” without guarantees of accuracy, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>No advice:</strong> nothing in the App is financial or betting advice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h2">7) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for lost profits, lost wagers, lost data, or indirect/consequential damages. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid to use the App in the 12 months before the claim (or €0 if none).</p>

  <h2 class="h2">8) Changes & availability</h2>
  <p>We may change features, suspend, or discontinue the App. We may update these Terms; we will post the new version in the App. If changes are material, we may request renewed consent.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">9) Governing law & disputes</h2>
